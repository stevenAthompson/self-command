- Refactored `self_command.ts` to use `spawn` with `detached: true` for the `delayed_submit.js` worker.
- Created `delayed_submit.ts` to handle the actual tmux interaction in a separate process.
- This ensures that the command injection survives the termination of the MCP server process (e.g., when the tool call completes).
- Verified build success.
- Fixed unit tests to mock `spawn` correctly and verify the detached worker process creation. Verified passing status (3/3 tests).
