## Final Polish and Portability Fixes
- Fixed `gemini_tmux.sh`:
    - Fixed bug where `CMD` was used before definition.
    - Added `export GEMINI_TMUX_SESSION_NAME` to ensure child processes (like the MCP server) know which session to target.
    - Improved existing session handling to always send the command if provided.
- Fixed `gemini-extension.json`:
    - Replaced hardcoded `/usr/bin/node` with `node`.
- Verified Portability:
    - All scripts now respect `GEMINI_TMUX_SESSION_NAME`.
    - `self_command.ts` uses `process.execPath` and `__dirname` for locating the worker script.
- Cleaned up references:
    - Confirmed no "run_long_command" references in code, documentation, or results.
- Verified Tests:
    - All tests pass with the new strict session validation.
